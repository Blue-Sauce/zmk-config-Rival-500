Rotary encoder in the Rival 500 (and most mice) appear to have the same construction as EC11 encoder.
EC11 encoder supported

EC11 Encoder disassembled https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/443918/how-to-best-clean-this-sealed-mechanical-rotary-encoder-volume-knob

Mouse buttons are not yet supported in ZMK, but seems close. Supported in QMK (3+ mouse buttons, L/R tilt wheel buttons, up/down scroll).

PMW3360 optical sensor not yet supported in ZMK, but seems close. Appears supported in QMK for mouse pointer movement.
